# Telegram casino bot

Telegram casino bot - working visual telegram bot at https://t.me/Tim_casino_bot with open source software written in Python that you can improve.

## Description

This idea was realized as the first big project that was created in the team. We set ourselves the task of creating the first working secure telegram casino bot with two games: poker and slot machine.
The project uses a database, commands for interacting with it via Telegram chat, and visualization algorithms.
This project can be considered complete, but if anyone wants to improve it, we will leave instructions on how to do it.

## Installation

After you've transferred the files from the repository to yourself, you need to install the pyTelegramBotAPI library in the console using the command:

```bash
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
```
After that, create a new bot in BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram, and then write the token of your bot in the api.txt file.
Now you can run the main.py file and start chatting with your bot. Write the command /get_admin_for_first_user in order for you, as the first user, to get administrator rights.
Write the command /help_for_admins to see the administration capabilities. You can then change the values in the database or through commands.
